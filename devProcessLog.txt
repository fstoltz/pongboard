Starting to get a grip of the way Node is setup, with help from the Express library. The issue at the moment is that I'm not able to successfully
implement "SELECT * from tableName" functionality, that would display all rows embedded in an html file or something similar.
I'm able to grab the data from the table in the SQLite database and console.log it, but when trying to for example iteratively build a string
containing the results, I get no output at the html page. I'm suspecting that this has to do with the fact that Node runs
asynchronously and something isn't happening in the right order. It could also just be because I'm not using JavaScript namespaces properly and
not building the string correctly and handling the return statements in the correct fashion, whether it's Call by Value / Reference etc. I'm not sure.
I'll have to look further into this issue before heading onto other tasks.
